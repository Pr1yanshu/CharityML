# CharityML
One of the projects of Udacity's Machine Learning nanodegree in which we have to find out whether the person will donate to charity organisation or not with the help of Most suitable supervised machine Learning methods 
The project was successfully completed and passed through the Udacity reviewer's panel.
Everything,inlcuding the data preprocessing,different model comparisons,accuracy computation is done and explained inside the jupyter notebook.
A great project for someone who is looking to brush up his basic machine learning skills.
